Getting an account
==================

As a regular user, getting started involves the following steps:

Before applying for an account, you should first have an SSH key-pair, and be ready to provide your public key as part of the account registration process. See :ref:`connecting-generate-ssh-keys` or contact your local IT support staff if you need further assistance.

Once you have your public SSH key ready, apply for your JADE@ARC account by going here:

www.arc.ox.ac.uk/jade-user-registration

and providing all of the required information.

You application will then need to be approved by the PI of the project. This process shouldn't take more than 2 working days.  If it takes more than that, check whether the PI or project manager is aware that you have applied, and therefore your application needs their approval.

When your account has been approved, you will receive an email from jade-support@arc.ox.ac.uk requesting your SSH public key. You should reply to this email with your key.

Once your account is set up by the team, you will receive an automated email with your JADE@ARC user id and temporary password.
