This is the documentation for the Joint Academic Data science Endeavour
(JADE) facility.

JADE\@ARC is a UK Tier-2 technology pilot resource, funded by EPSRC, owned and
hosted by the University of Oxford. The hardware was supplied and integrated by
Lenovo.

A consortium of UK universities, led by the University of Oxford, has been
awarded Â£5 million by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
(EPSRC) to  continue the world leading research enabled by the Joint Academic
Data science Endeavour (JADE) service. This forms part of a much larger
investment by EPSRC in the UK's regional Tier 2 high-performance computing
facilities, which aim to bridge the gap between institutional and national
resources.
